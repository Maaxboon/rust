    <h2>CITAM KAREN FOOTBALL TEAM</h2>
    <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
    <img src="fowad.jpg" alt="CITAM KAREN TEAM" height="500" width="600">
    <P>
        In early 2016, a group of <em>young men passionate about football and improving their football skills and
            building their faith
            in Christ,</em> most of whom who congregate at the same church (CITAM KAREN), decided to come together and
        create a football
        team. Cognizant of the unique resources and facilities that CITAM KAREN offers, such as a large football pitch,
        changing
        rooms, and media rooms that could be utilized to build a top-class football club. They would meet 5 times per
        week (Mon-Fri)
        at 4:30-6:30 p.m. and assemble at the grounds to practice their football skills and share God’s word. This is
        more than a
        football team, this is a group of young men who want to utilize and build their talents to further God’s
        Kingdom. Most of
        the players are part-time and aim to play at the highest possible level in the coming years.

        “Ever heard of Hillsong United? Yes! The popular Christian music band that writes good worship songs and, not to
        forget, the
        band that has impacted the whole world by making Christian music and church look good. They are an example of
        how God-given
        talent can impact the world positively. What caught us most are these statements by Joel Houston (their band
        leader): 'There
        is nothing special with us other than the fact that WE AVAILED ourselves to be used by God.' I think of Joel’s
        modest
        statement and my mind remembers the question God asked Moses when the Red Sea was before them: 'Moses, what do
        you have in
        your hand?' I immediately think of us Christians and the church that want to impact the world and be faithful
        ambassadors of
        Jesus Christ. We are asking God, how do we cross this Red Sea and minister to those people on the other side of
        the sea who
        are familiar with you? And God asks the same question He asked Moses, <em>'What do you have with you?'</em> And
        our answer as FOWAD SC
        is: <strong>'Impactful football, the talent you gave us.'</strong> And before we know it, this is what parts our
        Red Sea!”
